\section{W-mass}
\label{sec:w-mass}
With the finished calibration, the mass of the W-boson can now be measured. 
In order to determine the W-mass, we use a data set of actual ATLAS data containing $W \rightarrow e\nu$ events,
as well as several simulated data sets also containing $W \rightarrow e\nu$ events. 
There is also a $Z^0 \rightarrow e^+e^-$ data set to check the validity of the previous calibration. Finally there are data sets for QCD- and non-QCD background events.
